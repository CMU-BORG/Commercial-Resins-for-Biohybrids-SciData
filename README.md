## Overview:

These are the supplemental files associated with the article. The article encompasses 3 major investigations of multiple 3D-printable resins:

- Cytotoxicity

- Mechanical Testing

- Print Fidelity

Each directory encompasses files related to these studies.

### Directory: [Cytotoxicity](https://github.com/CMU-BORG/Commercial-Resins-for-Biohybrids-SciData/tree/f351759a86b12f52eb7a917f0f6e4eb815e601a2/Supplemental/Cytotoxicity)
The Excel spreadsheets in these files are the raw data exported from the plate reader with some organization in the subsequent sheets. The Excel spreadsheets each have 2 sheets: 
- RawData
  - This sheet is directly exported from the Agilent Synergy H1 plate reader and the relevant metadata for the plate reader.
- TableFormat
  - This takes the data exported from the plate reader (in 'RawData') and reformats it into a table format with the metadata associated with the raw data

  - Sub-Directory: [RESIN]: This sub-directory houses more directories, each labeled for the specific resin sample images (See [Table 2](#Table-2) below)

    - Sub-Directory: [STERILIZATION]: Within each resin directory, there are sub-directories for each sterilization condition (See [Table 3](#Table-3) below)

      - {images} Within the sterilization folder are the images (*.png) of the samples. Each image is of a different, distinct sample and labeled as follows: [resinType\]_[sterilizationType\]_Plate[pID]\_[sampleID].png.
        - The resin type [resinType] is in a shortened format. Refer to the [RESIN] directory housing the image for the longer name
        - The sterilization type [sterilizationType] is in a shortened format. Refer to the [STERILIZATION] directory housing the image for the longer name
        - The plate ID [pID] corresponds to the printing round that sample is part of since multiple prints were needed to fabricate all of the samples in the study
        - The sample ID [sampleID] corresponds to the individual sample for tracking purposes
        - For example, for "3DIPA_Au_Plate1_2.png" (Located [here](https://github.com/CMU-BORG/Commercial-Resins-for-Biohybrids-SciData/blob/f351759a86b12f52eb7a917f0f6e4eb815e601a2/Supplemental/Print%20Fidelity/BiocompatibilityResolutionCoupons/3DresynIPA/Autoclave/3DIPA_Au_Plate1_2.png)):

### Directory: [Mechanical Testing Data and Modeling](https://github.com/CMU-BORG/Commercial-Resins-for-Biohybrids-SciData/tree/f351759a86b12f52eb7a917f0f6e4eb815e601a2/Supplemental/Mechanical%20Testing%20Data%20and%20Modeling)
The Excel document in this folder contains the mechanical data for all tensile and compressive tests. Excess data after specimens failed are removed in the Compession_Rem and Tensile_Rem tabs for the compression and tensile tests respectively. The MATLAB files contain all of the analysis code used to process the force-length data into stress-strain data, fit the mechanical models according to the methods laid out in the main manuscript, generate the mechanical analysis results figures, and calculate the numerical metrics reported in the manuscript. The .tgn file is used to generate the table of Yeoh model parameters (Table 10). Finally, the MATLAB Outputs folder contains the generated outputs of the MATLAB scripts. Within these folders, the two .mat files contain the results of the mechanical model fits, and the Excel file contains the compile scalar metrics and Yeoh model parameters. The Output Figures folder contains the rendered data plots generated by the mechanical analysis MATLAB scripts.
